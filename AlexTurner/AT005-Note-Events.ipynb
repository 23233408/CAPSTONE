She was conscious but\\nThe family reports she had not been drinking much and had not\\nbeen feeling well one day prior to admission.  The family\\nalso reports a productive cough, 30 lb weight loss in the\\nlast three months, shortness of breath over the last few\\nmonths, worsened by exertion and increasing edema.\\n\\nThe patient was taken to the Emergency Department and rectal\\nand irregular.  Blood pressure was 137/76, respiratory rate 27.\\nCooling measures were started in the Emergency Department.\\nShe was placed on a 100% oxygen nonrebreather mask.  The\\npatient gradually became alert and oriented times two.  In\\nthe Emergency Department she subsequently became hypotensive\\nwith blood pressure of 80/49, heart rate 87 and irregular.\\nMore aggressive fluid resuscitation was started.  She was\\nbriefly placed on a Norepinephrine drip for hemodynamic\\ninstability which was later changed to a Levophed drip.  A\\ncentral line was placed.  The patient's temperature gradually\\ncame down to 98.6 over several hours.  Laboratory studies and\\nblood cultures were drawn.  Chest x-ray was done.\\nElectrocardiogram, urinalysis, arterial blood gases were doneand\\nthe patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cardiomyopathy- idiopathic, echocardiogram\\nin [**2141**] showed an ejection fraction of 20%.  Hypertension.\\nPulmonary hypertension. Chronic atrial fibrillation. Intermittent\\nleft bundle branch block. History of anemia and heme positive\\nstools (previously refused colonoscopy).  History of previous\\npulmonary embolism in [**2141**].  History of previous stroke in [**2141**].\\nHistory of previous myocardial infarction, (undocumented in\\n[**2144**]). Chronic right-sided pleural effusion, first found in\\n[**2150-11-12**].  History of multiple episodes of cellulitis.\\nClaustrophobia.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin 6 mg alternating 4 mg\\nq.d., Lasix 20 mg q.d., Lisinopril 10 mg q.d., Diltiazem 300\\nmg q.d., Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is an African American female\\nwho lived alone.  Family checks on her often and lives\\nnearby.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  There is a family history of colon cancer.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination (as noted in\\nEmergency Department/Medicine Intensive Care Unit notes).\\nGeneral, a thin malnourished African American female,\\ndisoriented.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils are\\nequal, round, and reactive to light, extraocular movements\\nintact.  Dry mucous membranes.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck\\nsupple.

Abdominal, positive bowel sounds,\\nsoft, nontender, nondistended, no rebound or guarding.  No\\nmasses.  Guaiac positive, rectal examination.  Extremities,\\nno edema, severe chronic venous insufficiency/stasis\\ndermatitis in the lower extremities, 1+ pulses bilaterally.\\nNeurological, no photophobia.  The patient waxes and wanes\\nwith her disorientation.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count showed white count\\n7.2, hematocrit 34.2, platelets 285, differential 96\\nneutrophils, 3 lymphocytes, 1 monocyte.  Chem-7, sodium 140,\\npotassium 4.8, chloride 100, bicarbonate 27, BUN 38,\\ncreatinine 1.4, glucose 157.  PT 25.4, INR 4.5, PTT 40.\\nLactate 1.8, calcium 9, magnesium 1.7, prostate 3.  CK was\\n53, alkaline phosphatase 137, total bilirubin 0.3, ALT 15,\\nAST 18.  Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at a\\nrate of 144 with left bundle branch block.  Chest\\nx-ray showed possible interstitial edema, persistent right\\nbasilar opacity which could represent pleural thickening or\\neffusion, possible infection process in the right lung.\\nInfection could not be excluded. New opacities in the left lung\\napex which were concerning for acute infection.\\n\\nINTENSIVE CARE UNIT COURSE:  In the Medicine Intensive Care\\nUnit pressors were discontinued a few hours after admission\\nsecondary to improved hemodynamic instability.  Repeat chest\\nx-ray showed possible pneumonia in the lower lobes with a\\ncavitary lesion in the left upper lobe concerning for\\ntuberculosis.  The patient was subsequently placed in\\nnegative pressure room with respiratory precautions started.\\nThe patient also had three cycles of induced sputums for acid\\nfast bacillus, smear and culture.  Antibiotics were\\ncontinued.  On hospital day #2 the patient began taking p.o.\\nShe remained afebrile throughout her hospital course.  On\\nhospital day #4 the patient was transferred to the Medicine\\nService and acid fast bacillus smear from hospital day #2\\ncame back as moderately positive for acid fast bacilli.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  Infectious disease - As noted above, repeat\\nchest x-ray showed cavitary lesions in the left apex.  On\\nhospital day #2 the patient was placed on\\nisolation/respiratory precautions with negative pressure\\nisolation room.  Acid fast sputums times three were taken for\\nacid fast bacilli.  On hospital day #4 sputum [**Doctor Last Name 1770**] from\\nhospital day #2 showed positive acid fast bacilli.\\nInfectious Disease consult was called. On hospital day #5 (\\n[**7-20**]), the patient was started on Isoniazid, Rifampin,\\nPyrazinamide for pulmonary TB, Ethambutol was started on hospital\\nday #6, Infectious Control and the Department of Public Health\\nwere notified and got in touch with the family members and\\nhospital staff.  The patient completed a seven day course of\\nCeftriaxone and Azithromycin for five days for question of\\naspiration pneumonia.  All of the patient's blood cultures\\nand sputum and urine cultures were.  She was Clostridium\\ndifficile negative and RPR negative.  There were three\\nattempts, one fluoroscopy guided, at lumbar puncture to evaluate\\nfor meningeal tuberculosis but were unsuccessful due to\\nsevere degenerative joint disease of the spine. Ultimately it was\\ndecided there was a low suspicion for CNS TB given the\\npatients improvement in mental status. Final recommendations for\\nduration of antituberculosis regimen will be given at a later\\ndate by Infectious Disease Service. Sensitivities are pending for\\ntuberculosis.  Tuberculosis was confirmed by PCR, gene probe. The\\npatient remained throughout the rest of the hospital day #2,\\nthroughout hospital course and isolation in negative pressure\\nroom with respiratory precautions.  She will remain so until she\\nhas negative acid fast bacillus cultures by three sputums.\\nSputum on hospital day #15 was positive for acid fast\\nbacilli and she thus remamined in isolation.\\n\\nPulmonary - The patient's initial acute respiratory acidosis\\nwas corrected with resolution of hypoventilation secondary to\\ncarbon dioxide retention and dehydration.  In the Medicine\\nIntensive Care Unit she was followed by repeated arterial\\nblood gases.  The patient denied shortness of breath\\nthroughout.  She was positive for productive cough.  The\\npatient did have an episode of somnolence when supplemental\\noxygen was turned up secondary to carbon dioxide retention.\\nSomnolence resolved with supplemental oxygen being decreased.\\nShe was kept on oxygen approximately .5 to 1 liter to keep\\nsaturations between 90 and 95%.  On hospital day #7 her\\nthoracentesis was performed on a new left effusion with no\\ncomplications, showed white blood cells of 50,l red blood\\ncells 2,500, differential of 16 neutrophils, 33 lymphocytes,\\nand 4 monocytes with 3 eosinophils.  Protein was 1.7, glucose\\n157, LDH 73, PH 7.8.  Gram stain negative.  [**Doctor First Name **] was negative.\\nSmear was negative.  Effusion consistent with a transudative\\nprocess.  On hospital day #12 thoracentesis was performed on\\nher right pleural effusion, red blood cells 50, red blood\\ncells of 3,200, protein 1.2, glucose 92, LDH 106, PH 7.26,\\ngram stain negative.  At the time of discharge [**Doctor First Name **] was still\\npending, smears were negative.  Cultures were at this time\\nstill pending and both pleural effusions were negative for\\nmalignant cells.\\n\\nCardiovascular - As noted above, the patient was in rapid\\natrial fibrillation initially.  By hospital day #2 and\\nthroughout course the patient remained in rate control atrial\\nfibrillation.  Digoxin, Lasix and Metoprolol were started.\\nLisinopril was also restarted.  Diltiazem was discontinued. The\\npatient was found to have a troponin leak.  Troponin peak was\\nnoted to be 14.6, CK MB ranged between 12 and 3.  CKs ranged\\nbetween 124 and 129.  It is thought that the high troponin\\nand CKs were secondary to myocardial damage suffered through\\nheat stroke.  Echocardiogram on hospital day #4 showed right\\natrium markedly dilated, mild symmetric left ventricular\\nhypertrophy, severe global ventricular hypokinesis, severely\\ndepressed left ventricular systolic function and pulmonary\\nhypertension. There was a question of a marantic endocarditis\\nversus degenerative changes on the aortic valve.  There was no\\nsignificant aortic valve stenosis, no aortic regurgitation. Prior\\nto previous report of [**2141-8-12**], there was no significant\\nchange in regards to left ventricular function.  On hospital day\\n#2 the patient underwent repeat echocardiogram which again showed\\nleft atrium moderately dilated, right atrium markedly dilated\\nwith left ventricular wall thickness normal.  The overall\\nleft ventricular systolic function at this time was\\nconsidered normal, greater than 55%.  There was mild to\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation\\nand again this could not rule out marantic endocarditis\\nthough echogenic density is noted on aortic cusps and were\\nconsistent with degenerative changes.  The patient was\\nsubsequently evaluated for infective endocarditis by blood\\ncultures times three and computerized tomography scan of the\\nhead looking for signs of emboli.  Computerized tomography\\nscan of the head results are subsequently pending at the time\\nof this dictation.  Digoxin level at discharge was 0.6.  It\\nis the recommendation of the Medicine Staff to restart\\nCoumadin at 5 mg approximately two days after discharge at\\nthe rehabilitation hospital and then to follow INRs every day\\nuntil therapeutic range is met.  We have very low suspicion for\\ninfective endocarditis.\\n\\nHeme - Coumadin was held secondary to supertherapeutic INR.\\nINR peaked at 7.7.  Vitamin K times one was given.  INR had\\nnormalized by hospital day #6.  Hematocrit was stable at 29.9\\nto 34 until hospital day #15 when hematocrit was found to be\\n27.5 secondary to occult gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient\\nwas transfused 1 unit which was well tolerated.  Follow up\\nhematocrit was 32.2.  Hematocrit remained stable for the rest\\nof the hospital course.\\n\\nRenal - Baseline creatinine is 1 to 1.4.  She arrived with\\nmild prerenal azotemia, diuretics were held.  During the\\nhospital course she required several boluses for low urine\\noutput.  The patient started mobilizing fluids approximately\\nhospital day #12.  Urine outpatient remained good thereafter.\\n\\nFluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Initial dehydration was\\ntreated with intravenous fluids.  She tolerated p.o.\\nthroughout her placement and was placed on a thin pureed diet\\nwith supplemental Boost at breakfast, lunch and dinner.  This\\nwas following swallow and nutrition evaluations for\\nmalnutrition.  She was also placed on thiamine, folate and\\nmultivitamin supplements.  Asymptomatic hypercalcemia was\\nnoted, because of the low setting of albumin 2.4.  Free\\ncalcium was noted to be 1.4, free calcium on discharge was\\nnoted to be 1.9.  During hospital stay her potassium rose to\\n5.5 secondary to increased dosage of ACE inhibitor,\\nsubsequently Lisinopril was decreased to 5 mg at which time\\nher potassium normalized.  Other laboratory studies were as\\nfollows, B12 7.9, folate 7.5, PTH 15, 25 hydroxy vitamin D,\\nless than 7.\\n\\nNeurological - Change in mental status secondary to heat\\nstroke/malnutrition.  Throughout the hospital course the\\npatient's mental status was alert, awake and oriented to two,\\nsometimes to three.  On discharge she is awake, alert and\\noriented times three.  Head computerized tomography scan on\\nhospital day #20 was performed, results are pending at the\\ntime of this dictation.\\n\\nGastrointestinal - The patient has a history of heme positive\\nstools with refusal of colonoscopy.  She had intermittent\\nguaiac positive stools while in-house.  She was seen by\\nGastrointestinal Service for possible occult malignancy\\nversus tuberculosis colitis.  Colonoscopy was performed on\\nhospital day #20 which showed diverticulosis and two polyps\\nin the right colon that were subsequently removed and\\nbiopsied.  Liver function tests were followed q. two weeks\\nsecondary to antituberculosis medications.  Liver function\\ntests after tuberculosis medications were started were within\\nnormal limits.  ALT was 22, ALT 23, LDH 342, alkaline\\nphosphatase 158, bilirubin 0.5.  Our medical team recommended\\nrehabilitation hospital follow liver function tests q. two\\nweeks.  Endomysal antibody was 3, this was within normal\\nlimits.\\n\\nEndocrine - Free cortisol was noted to be 22. The hyperclcemia\\nwas likely due to granulomatous disease (TB) and improved with\\ntreatment of the TB.\\n\\nMusculoskeletal - The patient complained early on of hip\\nsoreness.  X-ray of the pelvis showed no fractures.  The\\npatient was followed by physical therapy.  This improved over\\ntime.\\n\\nProphylaxis - The with Zantac for stomach, heparin for deep\\nvein thrombosis and fall and aspiration precautions were\\nmaintained throughout the hospital stay.\\n\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable to [**Hospital3 7**] for\\nrehabilitation..\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Maintain respiratory precautions\\nwhile keeping patient in isolation/negative pressure room.\\nThe patient will continue to need physical therapy.  Her diet\\nshould be regular plus Boost t.i.d.\\n\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n1.  Isoniazid 300 mg p.o. q.d.\\n2.  Rifampin 600 mg p.o. q.d.\\n3.  Pyrazinamide [**2149**] mg q.d.\\n4.

The INR\\n service attempted yesterday to do a lumbar puncture on the floor in this\\n patient who it was deemed difficult to turn prone.  This was not successful.\\n Therefore, today we were attempting to do it under fluoro.\\n\\n PROCEDURE:  The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure are\\n explained to the patient.\\n\\n The patient was brought to fluoro and the spine fluoroscope.  There is no\\n obvious space through which to put the needle.  It appears that her spinal\\n laminar space is closed.  Nonetheless attempts were made at two sites to place\\n 20 gauge spinal needles.  These did not successfully reach the CSF space.\\n\\n As we are at the patient's limit of tolerance, the procedure was discontinued.\\n If CSF is still considered necessary, we will consider cisternal tap.\\n\\n IMPRESSION:  Unsuccessful attempt at lumbar puncture under fluoro.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

There is extensive\\n reticular interstitial opacity throughout both lungs, most consistent with\\n severe pulmonary edema.  More dense consolidation is seen in the mid and upper\\n right lung, which is visible.  Please note again the right lung apex is\\n obscured.  There is an indwelling Port-A-Cath from a right subclavian approach\\n with the distal tip of the catheter at the superior cavoatrial junction.  The\\n mediastinum is difficult to assess.  The cardiac silhouette is borderline\\n enlarged.  The acuity of this finding is unknown.  There is no definite large\\n effusion.  No large pneumothorax is seen.\\n\\n IMPRESSION:  Multiple limitations as above.  There is diffuse and severe\\n pulmonary edema.  A dense consolidation on the right may indicate confluent\\n edema, although pneumonia or underlying mass lesion cannot be excluded.\\n\\n\\n\"]],\n",

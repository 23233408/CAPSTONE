The efficiency of each method was evaluated by five performance measures; accuracy, F-1 score, misclassification rate, R-square, and AUC. One crucial point that should be considered is that because the utilized data are imbalanced and accuracy for imbalanced information is biased toward the group with a higher population, this performance measure cannot be considered as a reliable measure for evaluation of the mentioned methods. However, the F-1 score is mainly used to evaluate methods that used imbalanced data are of interest.

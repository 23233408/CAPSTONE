For each patient admission, vast amounts of patient data are generated and recorded electronically, including vital signs, laboratory results, and medical history. 

Monitoring patients occurs at the ward

The traditional approach to data interpretation often involves manual assessment of various data points, which can lead to human errors, inconsistency in decision-making, and delayed diagnosis. 


**Clinical Complexity:**
Sepsis is a complex condition that can present with a wide range of symptoms, making it challenging to diagnose accurately. Mild or atypical cases of sepsis might be overlooked or misdiagnosed as other conditions.

**Subtle Symptoms:** 
In its early stages, sepsis symptoms can be subtle and nonspecific, such as fever, elevated heart rate, and fatigue. These symptoms can easily be attributed to other causes.

**Overlapping Symptoms:** 
Sepsis symptoms can overlap with those of other infections or medical conditions. This overlap can lead to misclassification and missed diagnosis.

**Diagnostic Criteria:** 
This inconsistency can lead to variability in coding practices.

**Clinical Awareness:** 
Healthcare providers might not always be aware of the latest guidelines for sepsis diagnosis and coding. Lack of awareness can result in missed opportunities to code and document sepsis cases accurately.

**Documentation Practices:** 
Accurate coding requires detailed and complete documentation of the patient's condition. If healthcare providers do not thoroughly document the clinical indicators of sepsis in the medical record, it can lead to undercoding.

**Time Constraints:** In busy clinical settings, healthcare providers may have limited time to thoroughly assess and document all clinical information related to a patient's condition.

**Diagnostic Delays:** Sepsis can develop rapidly, and delays in diagnosis and treatment can impact the accuracy of coding. If sepsis is diagnosed at a later stage, it might not be coded as a sepsis case.

**Coding Knowledge and Training:** Accurate coding requires knowledge of the specific coding guidelines and practices. Healthcare providers may not always have the necessary training in medical coding.

**Complex Coding Guidelines:** Coding for sepsis requires understanding complex coding guidelines and differentiating between various levels of severity. Errors or misunderstandings in these guidelines can lead to undercoding.

**Changing Health IT Systems:**
Transitioning to new electronic health record (EHR) systems or health IT platforms can sometimes lead to errors in coding due to learning curves and adjustments.

The early detection and prediction of patients who may develop sepsis is essential to improve the adverse consequences of sepsis. 

Since sepsis is a complex clinical syndrome, it contains a wide range of multifaceted clinical and biological features; therefore, a single clinical index may not be a good reflection of the disease state.

“no single or combined sets of signals providing good accuracy and minimum false positives.” (Parente et al., 2020, p. 2)

**Benefits of ML**
The use of machine learning models can improve patient safety, improve the quality of care, and reduce medical costs.

Necessary to identify high-risk patients and may enhance the understanding and facilitate clinical management of sepsis”

One of the major complexities is that no single or combined sets of signals, known as biomarkers, provide good accuracy and minimum false positives.

Sepsis has been commonly measured 
	Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score; the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score; the lactate, serum creatinine, and procalcitonin (PCT) levels; the white blood cell (WBC) count; and the neutrophil ratio (N%).





Will utilise demographic and clinical information, i.e., patient’s gender, age, severity level, mortality risk, admit type along with hospital length of stay.




**Proposal**


Develop a machine learning based risk score

to support clinicians’ timely identification and treatment of sepsis

  

instead of using prespecified thresholds, the ML behind the system learned multidimensional indicators of risk from the data, combining patient history and clinical presentation into a predictive risk score.

  

  

——

automatically and continuously monitors disparate clinical data, including vital signs, laboratory data, medication history, procedure and clinical history, and physician notes. It generates a continuous real-time “sepsis score” that can trigger an alert to healthcare staff.

Within hours, sepsis can cause widespread inflammation, organ failure and death.

early stage sepsis can be difficult to diagnose. Some electronic health record systems emit sepsis alerts when a patient shows signs of organ dysfunction and two out of four symptoms are detected: fever, elevated heartbeat, rapid breathing and high white blood cell count. However, because many illnesses share those symptoms, erroneous warnings are common.

  





  

Under the current standard of care, Saria explains, a health care provider should take notice when a patient displays any two out of four sepsis warning signs, including fever and confusion. Some existing warning systems alert physicians when this happens—but many patients display at least two of the four criteria during a typical hospital stay, Saria says, adding that this can give warning programs a high false-positive rate.

The development of screening tools for sepsis that use statistical and, more recently, machine learning methods is an active and important area of investigation,[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064418314860#bib6), [7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064418314860#bib7), [8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064418314860#bib8), [9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064418314860#bib9), [10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064418314860#bib10) and the development of these tools depends on the availability of “labeled data,” which in machine learning parlance refers to a data set that includes a reliable “target” (ie, the outcome of interest). Although not a criterion standard diagnostic, the Sepsis-3 definition does provide a consistent consensus-based target on which machine learning models can be developed and validated.

**Standard clinical variables for sepsis diagnosis**

commonly used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), modified early warning score (MEWS), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), and quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) scoring systems

Although not strictly a stage of sepsis, SIRS is often the precursor condition that can lead to sepsis. SIRS is identified by two or more of the following criteria:


Various disease scoring systems and diagnostic criteria are used in hospitals to identify patients with sepsis. Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) is the often the first step in sepsis diagnostic criteria.  The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis (Sepsis-3) is a redefinition of sepsis that has been recently introduced. This definition emphasises the priority of the non-homeostatic host response to infection, the possible lethality that is hugely over a straightforward infection, and the need for instant recognition. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoring system is used to track a person’s status during the ICU to determine the gamut of a person’s organ function or failure rate in Sepsis-3 guidelines. This predominant score is based on six different ratings: the mean arterial pressure, serum glucose, bilirubin, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, platelets, and creatinine. In the SOFAscoring system, an acute change higher than two or more points in the total SOFA score can indicate organ failure consequent to the infection. A higher SOFA score is correlated with an increase in the probability of mortality [21].


**Time**
We considered an evaluation ‘timely’ if it was entered within 3 h after the alert appeared in the EHR. The 3-h window was chosen to match the treatment window recommended by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sepsis core measure (SEP-1) and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines[38](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01895-z#ref-CR38),[39](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01895-z#ref-CR39),[40](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01895-z#ref-CR40).

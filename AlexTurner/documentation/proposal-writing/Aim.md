### Project Aim



Specific Objectives:

1. To collect and curate a dataset comprising clinical variables, vital signs, and laboratory test results from in-patient records.
2. To identify the most influential predictors for sepsis development through statistical analysis.
3. To build and validate a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the risk of sepsis in real-time.
4. To evaluate the model's performance through metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
5. To integrate the predictive model into the existing hospital information systems for real-time risk assessment and to develop an alert mechanism for healthcare providers.


_____

* Sepsis is without a criterion standard diagnostic test
* This study addressed whether a machine learning model could predict a risk score for sepsis identification that outperformed existing screening tools.


_____________


Sepsis is a common cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of stay, mortality and hospital cost.
However, 

Current sepsis scores are hierarchically calculated, creating significant case-control and/or misclassification biases in developing real-time diagnostic classifiers based on real-time clinical data. Also, 

Prevent the progression of 

Sepsis is defined as a subset of SIRS, arising when the patient is diagnosed as having SIRS and a confirmed infection based on cell culture. However, cell cultures take 24–48 h to return a result, limiting rapid diagnosis, and are not necessarily specific or reliable. Thus, ~50 % of sepsis cases diagnosed are “culture negative”

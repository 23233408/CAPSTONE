* Citing specific statistics or studies that highlight the limitations of current diagnostic methods

* Certain features in the data, such as blood samples, require up to 48 hours to receive back from the labs.

* creates a continuous, non-hierarchical sepsis score for hour-to-hour assessment using the same sepsis definition as the hierarchical scores commonly used [4, 14, 15] in a less continuous more intermittent fashion

* “no single or combined sets of signals providing good accuracy and minimum false positives.”

* One crucial point that should be considered is that because the utilized data are imbalanced and accuracy for imbalanced information is biased toward the group with a higher population, this performance measure cannot be considered as a reliable measure for evaluation of the mentioned methods. However, the F-1 score is mainly used to evaluate methods that used imbalanced data are of interest.

Vital features:
* 1. **HR**: Heart Rate - Measures the number of heartbeats per minute.
2. **O2Sat**: Oxygen Saturation - Indicates the level of oxygen in the blood, often given as a percentage.
3. **Temp**: Temperature - Body temperature, usually measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit.
4. **SBP**: Systolic Blood Pressure - The higher of the two blood pressure values, measuring the force of blood against the artery walls when the heart beats.
5. **MAP**: Mean Arterial Pressure - A calculated "average" blood pressure in an individual's arteries during one cardiac cycle.
6. **DBP**: Diastolic Blood Pressure - The lower of the two blood pressure values, measuring the force of blood against the artery walls when the heart is at rest between beats.
7. **Resp**: Respiratory Rate - The number of breaths taken per minute.

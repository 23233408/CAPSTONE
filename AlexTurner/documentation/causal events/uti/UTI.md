1. **Urine Culture**: To identify the type of bacteria causing the infection.
    
    - **Range**: Presence or absence of bacterial growth. A positive culture typically indicates a UTI.
2. **Urinalysis**: To check for signs of infection, such as leukocytes or nitrites.
    
    - **Leukocytes Range**: 0-5 WBCs/hpf (White Blood Cells per High Power Field)
    - **Nitrites Range**: Normally negative; positive indicates bacterial infection.
3. **WBC Count (White Blood Cell Count)**: Elevated levels can indicate infection.
    
    - **Range**: 4,500 to 11,000 cells per microliter (cells/ÂµL)
4. **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**: Elevated levels can indicate inflammation and infection.
    
    - **Range**: 0-10 mg/L; levels above 10 mg/L are generally considered high and indicative of infection or other inflammatory conditions.
5. **Blood Culture**: To check for bacterial infection in the blood, which would indicate the UTI has led to sepsis.
    
    - **Range**: Presence or absence of bacterial growth. Positive cultures indicate sepsis.
6. **Procalcitonin**: A marker that can indicate severe bacterial infection and sepsis.
    
    - **Range**: <0.1 ng/mL is normal; >0.5 ng/mL is indicative of severe infection or sepsis.

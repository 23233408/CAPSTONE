For sepsis, in particular, several EWS have been developed for the identification of preseptic patients in hospital wards, emergency departments (EDs), and intensive care units (ICUs) (4).

The continuous registration and collection of clinical and vital parameters in the ICU provide a unique opportunity to continuously calculate EWS for sepsis and adjust treatment thereupon (5). 
	<mark class="hltr-yellow" >Highlight</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=2&annotation=TMJSWQEL)

as patient populations tend to be rather hospital-specific based on the size of the hospital, location, and case-mix (4).

The TREWScore was trained on electronic health record (EHR) data from the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-II database to prospectively identify patients with septic shock in the ICU (9). With a high accuracy [0.83 area under the curve (AUC)] at a median diagnostic lead time of 28.2 h before shock onset, the TREWScore was received with great enthusiasm. 
	<mark class="hltr-yellow" >Highlight</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=2&annotation=S6G3QM3X)

From a total of 54 predictors, the TREWScore automatically selected 26 by removing uninformative predictors with lasso regularization (11). 
	<mark class="hltr-yellow" >Highlight</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=2&annotation=X74WLZI4)

As clinical practice differs among centers, not all predictors were recorded for the UMC ICU cohort and/or were measured in a different unit of measure.

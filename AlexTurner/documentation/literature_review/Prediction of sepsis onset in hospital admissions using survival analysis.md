* MIMIC-III dataset
* Survival analysis

Sepsis represents a significant burden to healthcare in terms of both patient outcomes and financial costs as it accounts for more than 50% of hospital deaths [1] and the average cost to the payor organizations, per sepsisrelated hospitalization is $18,023 when present on admission and $51,022 when it develops in the hospital [2]."

The distinction between sepsis that is present upon admission vs. onset that occurs during a hospital stay is an important one. Hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, mortality, payor costs, and readmission rate are all significantly worse for patients with sepsis that develops subsequent to hospital admission [2â€“4]."

Low prevalence of positive cases is not a concern as the assumptions for Cox proportional hazards are met under the conditions of the study design [23]. The DeepSurv model is also expected to be resilient to case imbalance as it incorporates the Cox modelâ€™s log-risk as itâ€™s activation function [18]." Yellow

Benefits of Cox proportional hazards

We used both â€˜last observation carried forwardâ€™ (LOCF) and median imputation to account for missing values." Yellow

We additionally implemented a deep learning-based survival methodology for comparison with regularized or nonregularized Cox models. The deep learning survival model (DeepSurv) is a feed forward neural network that has the activation function estimating the log-risk function of a Cox model and the objective function set to the average negative log partial likelihood [18]."

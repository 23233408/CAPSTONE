We constructed a prognostic model to predict a 30-day mortality risk in elderly patients with sepsis based on machine learning (RSF algorithm), and it proved superior to the traditional scoring systems. The risk factors affecting the patients were also ranked. In addition to the common risk factors of vasopressors, ventilator use, and urine output. Newly added factors such as RDW, type of ICU unit, malignant cancer, and metastatic solid tumor also significantly influence prognosis.

Elderly patients have low immunity [5], reduced organ reserve function, comorbidities such as diabetes and coronary heart disease are more common than younger patients [6], and atypical clinical symptoms after infection;

The algorithm uses internal data cross-validation to ensure high prediction accuracy without over-fitting, which is suitable for survival analysis of many diseases [12, 13]. The RSF model need not assume that variable for the influence of the risk function is linear, in addition to this, it can also rank the importance of variables, so as to screen variables with greater importance and reduce the dimension of variables [14, 15], which is beneficial to the application of the model in clinical practice [16, 17].

Current studies tend to add some new markers on the basis of the abovementioned scoring system [21, 22], or reconstruct the scoring system [23], to improve their performance in predicting disease prognosis.

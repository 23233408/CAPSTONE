We tested hypotheses arising from two possible alert fatigue mechanisms: (A) cognitive overload associated with amount of work, complexity of work, and effort distinguishing informative from uninformative alerts, and (B) desensitization from repeated exposure to the same alert over time.

Clinicians became less likely to accept alerts as they received more of them, particularly more repeated alerts. There was no evidence of an effect of workload per se, or of desensitization over time for a newly deployed alert. Reducing within-patient repeats may be a promising target for reducing alert overrides and alert fatigue.

The cognitive overload hypothesis was that likelihood of accepting alerts would decrease with increases in amount of work, complexity of work, and number of uninformative alerts.

A clinicianâ€™s likelihood of accepting best practice reminders dropped markedly with increases in the number of reminders, number of repeated reminders for the same patient, and overall patient complexity.

Our findings suggest that responses to textual alerts in EHRs are similar to previously documented responses to audible and visual alarms. [16â€“18] In other settings, low alarm informativeness and increased cognitive workload predict poor alarm response. Informativeness describes the ability of the alarm/alert to identify an important hazard; an uninformative alert is essentially a false alarm.

During sepsis, a complex network of cytokine, immune, and endothelial cell interactions occur and disturbances in the microcirculation cause organ dysfunction or even failure leading to high mortality in those patients. in this respect, numerous experimental and clinical studies indicate sex-specific differences in infectious diseases and sepsis. Female gender has been demonstrated to be protective under such conditions, whereas male gender may be deleterious due to a diminished cell-mediated immune response and cardiovascular functions."

low DHT and/or high estradiol appear to be protective for the host following adverse circulatory conditions, i.e., septic shock" Yellow

Moreover, gender should be taken into account when studying the immune or cardiovascular responses following sepsis." Yellow

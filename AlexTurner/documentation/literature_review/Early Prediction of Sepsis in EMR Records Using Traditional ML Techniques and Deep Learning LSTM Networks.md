predict sepsis using only the first 24 and 36 hours of lab results and vital signs for a patient.

created a data pipeline to process and clean data, identified important predictive features using RF and LR techniques, and trained LSTM networks. We found that our best performing traditional classifier, RF, had an Area Under the Curve (AUC-ROC) score of 0.696, and our LSTM networks did not outperform RF.

Events are irregularly sampled, include outlier data values, and can be entirely missing for some features and patients. Additionally, the same feature can be assigned multiple codes, which further complicates any processing.

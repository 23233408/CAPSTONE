several common measures, including the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score; the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score; the lactate, serum creatinine, and procalcitonin (PCT) levels; the white blood cell (WBC) count; and the neutrophil ratio (N%).

An elevated plasma concentration of CIRP was significantly associated with poor prognosis among patients with sepsis. Therefore, CIRP is a potential predictor of sepsis prognosis.

-	*Conclusion*

Biomarkers, including C-reactive protein, procalcitonin (PCT) and interleukin-6, are commonly used in the clinical setting to evaluate the severity of sepsis [8â€“10].

only one test was performed within 24 hours after enrollment

Third, we did not include non-septic patients in this study; thus, we were unable to determine whether the observed elevated plasma concentrations of CIRP were specific to sepsis.

Fourth, some of the enrolled patients may have been misdiagnosed with sepsis and may have ultimately developed etiologies of other diseases.

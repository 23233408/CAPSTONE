Early identification and appropriate management in the initial hours after the development of sepsis improve outcomes.

systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, vital signs, signs of infection, quick Sequential Organ Failure Score (qSOFA) or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) criteria, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), or Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) [26, 32]

Sepsis screening tools

Screening tools may target patients in various locations, such as in-patient wards, emergency departments, or intensive care units (ICU) [28‚Äì30, 32]." Yellow
	<mark class="hltr-yellow" >Highlight</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=2&annotation=ACK7ED7M)

Location of patients

Standard operating procedures are a set of practices that specify a preferred response to specific clinical circumstances [36].
	<mark class="hltr-yellow" >Highlight</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=2&annotation=F53CSXWY)

Recommendation 2. We recommend against using qSOFA compared to SIRS, NEWS, or MEWS as a single screening tool for sepsis or septic shock Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence
	<mark class="hltr-yellow" >Highlight</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=2&annotation=TYQ7JC2W)

Neither SIRS nor qSOFA are ideal screening tools for sepsis" Yellow
	<mark class="hltr-yellow" >Highlight</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=2&annotation=VQD69P3A)

Similar findings have also been found when comparing against the National Early warning Score (NEWS) and the Modified Early warning Score (MEWS) [44]." Yellow

The association of lactate level with mortality in patients with suspected infection and sepsis is well established [45, 46].
	<mark class="hltr-green" >Highlight</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=3&annotation=3URTE496)

Its use is currently recommended as part of the SSC Hour-1 sepsis bundle for those patients with sepsis [47, 48], and an elevated lactate is part of the Sepsis-3 definition of septic shock [49]. It has been suggested that lactate can also be used to screen for the presence of sepsis among undifferentiated adult patients with clinically suspected (but not confirmed) sepsis. Several studies have assessed the use of lactate in this context [50‚Äì52].
	<mark class="hltr-green" >Highlight</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=3&annotation=DM3N5R5L)

a weak recommendation favouring the use of serum lactate as an adjunctive test to modify the pretest probability of sepsis in patients with suspected but not confirmed sepsis." Yellow

failure to receive 30¬†ml/kg of crystalloid fluid therapy within 3¬†h of sepsis onset was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality"

Aftermath

Infection Diagnosis of¬†infection Recommendation 11. For adults with suspected sepsis or septic shock but unconfirmed infection, we recommend continuously re‚Äëevaluating and searching for alternative diagnoses and discontinuing empiric antimicrobials if an alternative cause of illness is demonstrated or strongly suspected
	<mark class="hltr-green" >Highlight</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=6&annotation=M5XWP995)

we recommended that appropriate routine microbiologic cultures (including blood) should be obtained before starting antimicrobial therapy in patients with suspected sepsis and septic shock if it results in no substantial delay in the start of antimicrobials (i.e. < 45¬† min
	<mark class="hltr-yellow" >Highlight</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=6&annotation=XX8M9C9T)

The signs and symptoms of sepsis are nonspecific and often mimic multiple other diseases [90‚Äì92].
	<mark class="hltr-green" >Highlight</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=6&annotation=99JJ7KVR)

ince there is no ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù test to diagnose sepsis, the bedside provider cannot have a differential diagnosis of sepsis alone in a patient with organ dysfunction. Indeed, a third or more of patients initially diagnosed with sepsis turn out to have non-infectious conditions [90, 93, 94]." 
	<mark class="hltr-yellow" >Highlight</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=6&annotation=63PYTCZE)

Best practice is to continually assess the patient to determine if other diagnoses are more or less likely, especially since a patient‚Äôs clinical trajectory can evolve significantly after hospital admission, increasing or decreasing the likelihood of a diagnosis of sepsis. With this uncertainty, there can be significant challenges in determining when it is ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù to de-escalate or discontinue antibiotics.
	<mark class="hltr-green" >Highlight</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=6&annotation=9WC8ANW6)

Biomarkers to¬†start antibiotics Recommendation 16. For adults with suspected sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against using procalcitonin plus clinical evaluation to decide when to start antimicrobials, as compared to clinical evaluation alone
	<mark class="hltr-green" >Highlight</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=7&annotation=AZM74RP8)

Source control may include drainage of an abscess, debriding infected necrotic tissue, removal of a potentially infected device, or definitive control of a source of ongoing microbial contamination [262].
	<mark class="hltr-green" >Highlight</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=21&annotation=V2EJGFNL)

Source of infection

intra-abdominal abscesses, gastrointestinal perforation, ischaemic bowel or volvulus, cholangitis, cholecystitis, pyelonephritis associated with obstruction or abscess, necrotizing soft tissue¬†infection, other deep space¬†infection¬†(e.g., empyema or septic arthritis), and implanted device infections [262].
	<mark class="hltr-green" >Highlight</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=21&annotation=U7RVQFZJ)

source of infection

C Reactive Protein is often used in this regard. Procalcitonin has been studied most extensively both in critically ill and non-critically ill patients, both for initiation and discontinuation of therapy [307].

Biomarkers to discontinue antibiotics

![[evansSurvivingSepsisCampaign2021-23-x47-y283.png]]

Vasopressors have been traditionally administered via a central venous access due to concerns of extravasation, local tissue ischaemia and injury if administered peripherally. However, the process of securing central venous access can be time consuming and requires specialised equipment and training that may not be available in under resourced settings even in high income countries, leading to a delayed initiation of vasopressors [385]."

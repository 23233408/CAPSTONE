In 2021, Wong and colleagues validated the Epic Sepsis Model (ESM), an algorithm for detecting sepsis implemented and used by hundreds of hospitals (4). During the validation, the ESM had poor discrimination (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.63) and calibration, far worse than the initially reported AUC of 0.76 to 0.83. Physicians needed to evaluate 109 patients to detect 1 case of sepsis earlier than without the ESM. More recently, a prospective study evaluated the impact of using the Targeted Real-time Early Warning System (TREWS) to improve patient outcomes (5). Researchers have been developing and fine-tuning the TREWS for years, reaching an AUC of 0.97 for detecting sepsis and flagging 82% of cases.

Starting in 2018, TREWS was deployed in five hospitals as part of a multisite study of patient outcomes after using the alert. Impressively, the TREWS retained adoption rates of 89% throughout this study (5)

A significant concern lies within the control group, which is highly heterogeneous and may have included many patients without sepsis.

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools already impact sepsis care.   Up to now, no large-scale, randomized controlled trialâ€“level evidence demonstrates the clinical benefits of AI-based alerts for patients with sepsis.   Sepsis alerts may trigger the unnecessary use of antibiotics.   The proprietary nature of many AI tools can make independent validation challenging.   Caution should be exercised when using early sepsis detection tools.

An alert may lead to an overuse of diagnostics and antimicrobial therapy.

The MIMIC-III database was filtered toextract 5,400 trauma patient records (526 non-survivors)each ofwhich contained 5static variables (age, gender, etc.) and 28 dynamic variables (e.g., vital signs and metabolic panel). Training data was also extracted from the dynamic variables using a3-hour moving time window whereby each window was treated as aunique patient-time fragment. We extracted the mean, standard deviation, and skew from each ofthese 3-hour fragments and included them as inputs for training.

Since modern intensive care units (ICU) monitor patients continuously, the data-rich environment can be used to predict mortality, time-dependent risk, and provide opportunities for data science and machine learning [2,3]. Due to the high patient-to-patient variability, adata-driven approach isareasonable way of predicting patient outcomes as patient-scale mechanistic models developed from first principles are highly challenging and likely injury-specific [4â€“6].

exclusion criterion consistent with the work of Alistair et al., where patients were excluded ifthey were neonatal or pediatric patients (age < 16), presented in the ICU for less than 4hours,

# summary

Data pipeline using MIMIC-III

Uses KNN with a custom distance metric (to replace Euclidean distance) in order to impute missing data

# notes

From a machine learning perspective, despite the availability of a significant amount of unstructured data [7, 8], advanced and novel preprocessing techniques are required to make sense of the data. Moreover, sepsis treatment consists of modeling irregularly-sampled time series with long-term dependencies [9] which adds to its complexity." Gray

especially where more rapid action is required

An approach mixing SQL queries and Julia programming [23] was chosen to properly organize data. To mitigate the long time horizon concerning other methods [19], we modified the time discretization from four-hour steps to one-hour steps to better model the biological processes under test. This, however, makes the missing-value imputation step more challenging. We address this by a novel method for matrix completion detailed in the following subsection" Yellow

2.2 Missing-value imputation The dataset contains substantial amount of missing values which has to be taken care of. In the particular case of sepsis, we require some variables to be known to be able to apply the Sepsis-3 criteria [21] to decide whether apatient suffers from sepsis or not." Yellow

All features contain missing-values. Because of this, aclassical k-nearest-neighbors (kNN) model for imputation isnot directly applicable since itrequires acommon ground between observations to compute pairwise distances (and gather nearest neighbors)." Green

To overcome this problem, we introduce the following distance metric that isable to handle missing values and will replace the euclidean distance in the kNN computations. The distance isdefined as:" Green

2.3 State representation Itishard to find an approximation of the formations contained in the continuous raw data into atabular form, specially due to high dimensionality. In this regard, the following problems arises: â€¢The amount of data islimited. Therefore, the train-test split of data faces atrade off, for avoiding overfitting. Hence, careful considerations has to be taken into account for efficient sampling. â€¢Edge cases and outliers in the data should not be ignored as they are special disease patterns." Gray

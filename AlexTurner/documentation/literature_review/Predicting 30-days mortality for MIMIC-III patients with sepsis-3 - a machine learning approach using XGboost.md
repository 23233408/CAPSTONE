the early identification and diagnosis for sepsis are essential, which could provide meaningful information for clinicians to assess patients‚Äô condition and improve survival outcomes through prompt and appropriate treatment.

Due to the complex of vague sepsis syndrome definitions, unknown sources of infection and higher mortality, it is necessary to establish a reliable and effective prognostic model for sepsis. With the help of these prognostic models, strong evidences for clinical decision-making and rational allocation of public health care resources can be provided.

The database contains charted events such as demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, fluid balance and vital status; documents International Classification of Diseases and Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes; records hourly physiologic data from bedside monitors validated by ICU nurses; and stores written evaluations of radiologic films by specialists covering in the corresponding time period.

Adult patients who were diagnosed with sepsis-3 were included in our study. The inclusion criteria were: (I) patients who were older than 18¬†years old; (II) length of stay in the ICU was over 24¬† h to ensure sufficient data for analysis; (III) patients with the diagnosed of sepsis according to The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (sepsis-3) [2].

As it is common with missing data in the MIMIC-III database, we also removed the variables with more than 20% observations missing to facilitate and ensure the accuracy of the review.

As it is common with missing data in the MIMIC-III database, we also removed the variables with more than 20% observations missing to facilitate and ensure the accuracy of the review. However, for those with less than 20% missing data or randomly missing data, we explored and visualized them with Templ‚Äôs method (R Package ‚ÄúVIM‚Äù) [14] and multiple imputation method (R Package ‚Äúmice‚Äù) [15] for further analysis respectively.

Following demographic data were extracted: age, gender, ethnicity, weight, height and body mass index (BMI), length of stay in hospital, length of stay in the ICU, hospital expire flag (in-hospital death recorded in the hospital database) at the first ICU admission. Then, we collected vital signs of the patients from the first 24¬†h of ICU stay, including heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), temperature (TEMP), respiratory rate (RR) and oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2). Afterwards, laboratory values, such as blood routine examination, liver and kidney function, blood glucose, and arterial blood gas

(ABG) were abstracted. Furthermore, advanced cardiac life support (mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, etc.) and accompanied diseases (diabetes, malignant tumour, etc.) were accessed. Because of the high sampling frequency, we use the maximum, minimum and the mean value when incorporating the characteristics of vital signs and related laboratory indicators.

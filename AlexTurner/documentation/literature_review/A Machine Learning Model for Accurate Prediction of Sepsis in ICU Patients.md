-	*Provides a clinical explanation of early identifiers*

a set of 55 features (variables) was calculated and passed to the random forest algorithm to predict the onset of sepsis 
	<mark class="hltr-yellow" >Highlight</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=1&annotation=GT8F4I9H)

To date, the diagnosis of sepsis has largely relied on determining the presence of infection and organ dysfunction (4).

The early detection and prediction of patients who may develop sepsis is essential to improve the adverse consequences of sepsis.

calcitonin, C-reactive protein, white blood cells, platelets, and lactic acid (6, 7).

Since sepsis is a complex clinical syndrome, it contains a wide range of multifaceted clinical and biological features; therefore, a single clinical index may not be a good reflection of the disease state 
	<mark class="hltr-gray" >Highlight</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=2&annotation=RLJG5TY8)

Bloch et al. constructed a sepsis prediction model based on the four vital signs of mean arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature (10).

The use of machine learning models can improve patient safety, improve the quality of care, and reduce medical costs (20).

necessary to identify high-risk patients and may enhance the understanding and facilitate clinical management of sepsis

used the random forest algorithm to predict the risk of sepsis in ICU patients by analyzing laboratory/clinic data as follows: (i) lipids, (ii) liver function, (iii) hemagglutination, (iv) blood cells, (v) renal function, and (vi) electrolyte. The essential idea of the random forest algorithm is to build multiple decision trees to reduce the correlation between trees using bootstrap aggregating or bagging, which can avoid the overfitting problem.

-	*Identify the candidate features, then remove irrelevant or redundant features, which may mislead the models.*

It can be observed in Figure 3 that the error value remained at a similar degree when the number of features reached 20. Therefore, we utilized a combination of 20 selected features to predict sepsis in ICU patients (shown in Supplementary Table 3): neutrophils%, D-dimer, neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, albumin, white blood cells (WBCs), direct bilirubin, potassium, calcium, cholinesterase, magnesium, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), prothrombin time (PT), lymphocytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), basophils%, total cholesterol (TBIL), urea, and platelets (PLT).

To our knowledge, most previous studies have developed models to predict the prognosis of sepsis. However, only few researchers have paid attention to the differences in the incidence of sepsis after infection, although it is important for clinical preventive intervention.

The variables in our model were mainly blood cells, lipids, liver function, hemagglutination, renal function, electrolyte, enzyme, and others. Interestingly, blood-related variables accounted for a large part of our model; the first five variables in Figure 2 are related to the blood system.

blood cells, including eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and WBCs, are also associated with the bodyâ€™s defense against infection

Platelets are the main effector cells involved in blood coagulation and can promote the development of excessive inflammation, DIC, and microthrombosis (48). PT can reflect the coagulation function of the body, and D-dimer levels increase under hypercoagulable state (49).

Though using traditional models with low performancewas not successful in this field, machine learning models can support clinicians in identifying potentially effective clinical variables in sepsis.

Then, records of patients younger than 18 yearsold and over 85 years old were removed. The patients with lower than 24 h of admission to the ICU were excluded too.

Our dataset was split into a trainingset (80%) and a test set (20%)

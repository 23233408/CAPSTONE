New Algorithm Tool Designed to Identify Sepsis Risk in ED 

https://www.ehealth.nsw.gov.au/news/algorithm-tool-to-identify-sepsis 

* NSW government
- developed a clinical decision support tool (CDST) called the Sepsis Risk Tool Dashboard that combines a patient’s age, gender and vitals as they are entered into the EMR 
- dashboard passes this information through an algorithm trained on historic data concerning patients with sepsis to create a risk score 
- A risk percentage is calculated for each patient to support the clinician in assessing if sepsis is a risk or not 
- If clinical deterioration in sepsis is detected earlier in these patients, then decisions linked to time critical treatments (e.g. antibiotics) can occur much earlier in the patient journey

Smart Sepsis Predictor (SSP) 
	<mark class="hltr-orange" >Highlight</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=1&annotation=BJPK58EG)

SSP is a deep neural network architecture that encompasses long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional, and fully connected layers 
	<mark class="hltr-orange" >Highlight</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=1&annotation=FUUR94QR)

Using ICU data, sepsis onset can be predicted up to 12 h in advance.

Various disease scoring systems and diagnostic criteria are used in hospitals to identify patients with sepsis [17,18]. Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) is one of the first sepsis diagnostic criteria [19,20]. The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis (Sepsis-3) is a redefinition of sepsis that has been recently introduced [4]. This definition emphasizes the priority of the non-homeostatic host response to infection, the possible lethality that is hugely over a straightforward infection, and the need for instant recognition. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoring system is used to track a personâ€™s status during the ICU to determine the gamut of a personâ€™s organ function or failure rate in Sepsis-3 guidelines. This predominant score is based on six different ratings: the mean arterial pressure, serum glucose, bilirubin, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, platelets, and creatinine. In the SOFAscoring system, an acute change higher than two or more points in the total SOFA score can indicate organ failure consequent to the infection. A higher SOFA score is correlated with an increase in the probability of mortality [21].

The overall structure of the SSP is shown in Fig. 1. SSP takes three types of input data (vital signs, laboratory tests, and demographics) in two modes: Mode 1 and Mode 2. In Mode 1, it uses vital signs and de mographics. In Mode 2, it also takes laboratorytests. The first step of SSP is an inclusion block, through which unfavorable records are filtered. Following this, a deep network block containing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), convolutional, and fully connected layers is used to estimate the probability of sepsis onset. By applying a pre-set reference threshold, the model can assess whether the patient is suspected of sepsis or not.

# Summary

EHR MIMIC-II data

prospectively identify patients with septic shock in the ICU
high accuracy - (0.83 area under the curve (AUC) - at a median diagnostic lead time of 28.2 h before shock onset, the TREWScore was received with great enthusiasm.

From a total of 54 predictors, the TREWScore automatically selected 26 by removing uninformative predictors with lasso regularization.


# Annotations
early recognition and treatment are critical to successful outcomes4. Early administration of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, in particular, is associated with decreased mortality and morbidity5â€“10.

we found that sepsis patients who had their alert evaluated and confirmed within 3 h had a 1.85-h lower median time from alert to first antibiotic order [[Factors driving provider adoption of the TREWS machine learning-based early warning system and its effects on sepsis treatment timing|henryFactorsDrivingProvider2022]]

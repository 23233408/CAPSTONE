Although not a criterion standard diagnostic, the Sepsis-3 definition does provide a consistent consensusbased target on which machine learning models can be developed and validated." Yellow

Traditional screening tools have the advantage of being relatively easy to describe and can often be calculated without assistance at the bedside. However, there is evidence suggesting that machine learning algorithms outperform traditional alternatives in contexts in which data inputs are abundant and where there is high potential for complex variable interactions.11-13" Orange

studies have already shown that machine learning models offer improved sepsis prognostication compared with the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), quick Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), and the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) among ICU patients.6-8,10" Orange

early initiation of treatment for sepsis is associated with significant reductions in morbidity and mortality." Orange

Outcome Measures We used the clinical surveillance criteria proposed by Rhee et al5 as our standard definition of sepsis and as the primary target for developing our model (Figure E1, available online at http://www.annemergmed.com)." Red

causality: if A is a cause and B is an effect, then B relies on A for its value. As causal relations are directional, the reverse is not true; A does not rely on B for its value.

Even though data from EHRs, for example, are usually observational, they have already been successfully leveraged in several ML applications [17], such as modelling disease progression [18], predicting disease deterioration [19] and discovering risk factors [20], as well as for predicting treatment responses [21].

the best treatment for an individualâ€”the main goal of precision medicine [26]â€”can only be identified with a model that is capable of causal reasoning

Figure 3. We illustrate the difference between individualized and average treatment effect (ITE versus ATE). â€˜Featureâ€™ represents patient characteristics, which would be multi-dimensional in reality. â€˜Outcomeâ€™ is some measure of response to the treatment, where a more positive value is preferable. The ITE for each patient is the difference between actual and the counterfactual outcome. We show an example counterfactual to highlight that ITE for some patients might differ from the average (ATE). By employing causal inference methods to estimate individualized treatment effects, we can understand which patients benefit from certain medication and which patients do not, thus enabling us to make personalized treatment recommendations. Note that the patient data points are evenly distributed along the feature axis, which would indicate that this data comes from an RCT (due to lack of bias). The estimation of treatment affect using observational data is subject to confounding as patient characteristics affect both the selection of treatment and outcome. Causal inference methods need to mitigate this.

Managing diseases such as AD can be challenging due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and their trajectory over time across the population. A pathology might evolve differently for patients with different covariates. For treatment decisions in a longitudinal setting, CI methods need to model patient history and treatment timing [65].

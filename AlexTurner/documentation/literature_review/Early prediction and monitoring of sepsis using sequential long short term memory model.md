The network operates on time series data and predicts the probability of a patient developing sepsis based on the historical medical data of the patient

A time series data is data in which the data points are recorded at a regular interval of time and are time dependent.

Recurrent neural network (RNN) is known to learn time series data but has its own limitation of vanishing and exploding gradients as a result of weight updation through backpropagation. Long short term memory (LSTM) networks, on the other hand, were developed for the detection of long-term dependencies in real-time series data and advancement on RNN.

failed organs, damaged tissue, or death. Infections caused by bacteria are the major cause of sepsis.

early warning scores to detect patient deterioration, such as National Early Warning Score (NEWS2), have a broader purpose and are not specifically developed for sepsis6.

Sepsis patients had a median baseline Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 0 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0â€“1), at sepsis onset had a median SOFA of 2 (IQR: 2â€“4) and had a median worst SOFA of 3 (IQR: 2â€“5).

causal probabilistic network (CPN) 
	<mark class="hltr-yellow" >Highlight</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/?page=2&annotation=EKCDWU4P)

A limitation of several previous studies of machine learning based sepsis prediction tools is the use of administrative data to classify sepsis cases19â€“21. In this study, we used an objective sepsis classification based on clinical data, which is more reliable, less prone to bias, and robust over time22,23.

We focused on patients in the emergency department or non-ICU wards.

CPNs are interpretable models, which are inherently explainable33.

routine measurements of heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, oxygen delivery (liters/minute), mental status, c-reactive protein, white blood cell count, platelets, bilirubin, creatinine, urea, albumin, lactate, HCO3, pH, current department, and time since surgery

Measurements were filled forward without backfilling missing measurements. Only the most recent measurement, along with the time since it was measured, was used at each screening. As an input for model training, a discretized time-to-sepsis label was used.

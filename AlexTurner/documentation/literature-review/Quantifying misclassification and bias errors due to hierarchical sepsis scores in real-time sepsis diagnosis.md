“Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is common in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, diagnosed when two or more of altered temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and white blood cell count are present [1–4].” 

“no single or combined sets of signals providing good accuracy and minimum false positives.”

“if the SIRS score symptoms are successfully treated, then the diagnosis of sepsis can “disappear”, even when it is clear, hour-to-hour, the infection and organ failure, and thus severe sepsis or worse, remain.” 

“creates a continuous, non-hierarchical sepsis score for hour-to-hour assessment using the same sepsis definition as the hierarchical scores commonly used [4,14,15] in a less continuous more intermittent fashion [29].”

“Clinical data comprises hourly measures of: a) model-basedinsulin sensitivity (SI) [32–34]; SIRS score; heart rate; temperature; systolic and diastolic blood pressure; and respiratory rate. SI is a proven metabolic metric in clinical use, diabetes diagnosis and a rangeof other studies showing it reflects patient-specific inflammatory and sepsis state although not to high diagnostic quality levels desired [35–38]. SI is identified from hourly data on insulin and nutrition given, and blood glucose measurements [39,40], and is highly correlated to the state and evolution of metabolic and physiological response [41–45].”

   


“Diagnostic performance and quality was assessed using ROC curves, diagnostic odds ratios, sensitivity/specificity, and likelihood ratios for resubstitution (best case), bootstrap (worst case), and .632 bootstrap (expected case) estimates. Considering the expected case test performance, the classifier developed provided good to very good results, potentially able to change clinical decisions, but were not at the highest level of diagnostic accuracy desired for all performance metrics considered. Finally, the results also illustrated more general issues and outcomes related to the development and testing of such computational sepsis diagnostics. In particular, the wide range of quality and performance metrics provided robustness in the ability to assess the potential of the estimator that any one or two metrics could not, avoiding bias in assessing the classifier overall. Likelihood ratios are seen to be a better choice for assessing sepsis diagnostics and classifiers as clinical decision making in sepsis relies on similar odds in making inferences on the presence (or absence) of infection and thus on how treatment should progress.”

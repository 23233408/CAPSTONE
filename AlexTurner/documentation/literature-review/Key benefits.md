Provide a risk score and to aid in clinical decision-support

Early warning system

-  Provide information on the value of RPH data in identifying mineral footprints which will contribute to a roadmap to guide RPH for future data collection and delivery strategies to promote better success in mineral exploration in AREA_A.

Identify common features within the MIMIC-III dataset for identifying the onset of sepsis



Offer a clinical decision-support tool for healthcare professionals. By providing timely alerts and risk scores, the system will empower clinicians to intervene promptly and provide optimal patient care and improved patient outcomes. 

Enhance resource allocation within healthcare facilities by focusing attention on patients at higher risk of sepsis. This will lead to more efficient use of medical resources, potentially decreasing the length of hospital stay, labour, reducing the cost of late-stage sepsis treatment. more sustainable healthcare system.

Contribute to the advancement of medical knowledge by analysing patterns in RPH patient data, and identifying factors associated with sepsis risk. The insights derived from the models can be used to guide future research and interventions in the field of sepsis management, as well as the 





Prevent sepsis from advancing to more severe stages by administering appropriate medical treatments early in the course of sepsis. 
Improved survival rates, reduced long-term organ damage, avoid less aggressive  and invasive medical interventions.

- Preventative measures
- identify high-risk patients and may enhance the understanding and facilitate clinical management of sepsis.






- In order to accurately predict sepsis onset, the models need to simulate and understand irregularly collected data over time, particularly focusing on the relationships between past and present data points in order to identify abnormalities that are present in the lead up to a sepsis event. The dynamics of a sepsis progression can however be subtle, which is also why it is important for the model to maintain a consistent risk profile, or context, over time. This impacts the healthcare staff at the HIVE, alerting them only when there is a valid, current risk, thereby minimising false alarms and ultimately enhancing the efficiency of the RPH healthcare system. 
    

- SIRS criteria fall short in capturing the complexity of sepsis due to the lack of sufficient features. Composite features, which aren’t easily defined by clinicians in a real-time scenario, may improve the accuracy of the prediction 
    

- The imbalance in high patient load and staffing constraints lead to a limit to how frequently healthcare providers can monitor each patient’s condition.

- The assessment of sepsis risk involves considering multiple factors and their interactions. Machine learning based models may analyse complex data patterns with ease.

- Reduce false-positive alerts contributing to healthcare provider fatigue and unnecessary costs by employing context-aware algorithms.

Accurately identify

The model aims to adapt to new information monitored, be robust to the clinical environment, have a high precision, but also maintain context in order to minimise healthcare alerts

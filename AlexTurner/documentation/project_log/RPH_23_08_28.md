Kha explain main table
- Df_demographics

- 50k observation
- sweetviz 

- statistic information

- gender, age, sepsis

- Lab Events

- 20M observations (753 ItemID * 2) + 3


**SAMPLE**
= 800k x 1500 = 3.6gb

  
- Age
- Bar chart for comparing proportions
- box plot
- range of age 

  
- EDA for sepsis patients should occur first
- need to split ITEM_ID into bins
- correlation matrix with ‘is_sepsis’ (y truth)


- USE GITLAB ISSUES

  
- Missing HADM_ID - confirm with Shiv
- Anonymised data
- Age - median age of sepsis
- HADM_ID 

- do we remove the patients without HADM_ID?
- Search DISCHARGE_LOCATION for “HOME” or for “SNF” (skilled nursing facility)
- SHORT TERM HOSPITAL
- Drop the missing HADM
- Copy from the last HADM_ID

  
- distribution of missing hadm_id 
- with discharge location

- Path names

- shall we use ‘../‘ ? 
- how to make OS agnostic - different for windows

  

import pathlib

relpath = pathlib.Path( get_start_path())  # Eg. current directory or something.

logpath = relpath / "logs" / logfile  

  

  

# VSCode challenges
Branches
- Are we working from folders in Main branch, or from separate branches?

Venv
* My .venv is taking 2.5mins to merge tables.



- Setting up virtual env
- Confirmation of GitLab
- Pulling from GitLab
- Data is outside of the root directory?

  
Cleaning
- from source data raw files? not from the processed file?
- LABEVENTS has missing HADM_ID

CHART_TIME, HADM_ID, SUBJ_ID
- If chart time (lab_events) is in between Admit and discharge time,
- then HADM_id in lab events should == hadm_Id in Admission

**VENV**

- conda create -n env-01 python=3.9 scipy=0.15.0 numpy

conda list -n myenv

[https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually) 

[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments) 

  

- Finally, using a package manager for Python (pip), you can run the following from the root directory of this repository to install all necessary python packages:

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

  

**Current Data pipeline** 

- 4000 observations max?

- too large to open

- 5590005

  


Evaluation of the Sepsis-3 guidelines in MIMIC-III

- can use to get sepsis cohort?

Schema for MIMIC

time Series - torch example

the read me has data preprocessing

**Setting the population size**

- Environmental variable pop_size

- for running a small subset of patients

  

  

**MIMIC EXTRACT**

*** Important to go through and understand

- end of this file has expected table that we need

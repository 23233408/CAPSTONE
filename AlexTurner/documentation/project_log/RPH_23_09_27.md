Red and blue - correlation
Only from bloods

- Medications
	- filter based on patients with 


**LSTM model:**
Can't be sigmoid - has to be softmax 
Must be binary cross entropy
use categorical
use sample weights instead of class weights
use validation: split = 0.1


**Survival analysis**
Can't use light censoring
- can't use cox ph. Have to use scikit survival GBM

If sepsis at t0, not using these patients

if death, and known ICD sepsis, then consider time
For people who are alive and have been discharged,
For people with no sepsis, if they have died, don't con

Two columns:
* Is discharge time
* Is death
* Is sepsis

Remove people who has sepsis and haven't died



**Standardisation**
min max - keep all points between -1 and 1. intr
if you have something very small, you cannot train. 
Every feature, you cannot remove outliers
Standard deviation is nothing but up the top (between -1 and 1) in standardisation





**Binary classification for patient history**
history of diabetes (with and without complications), dementia, malignant tumors or metastatic solid tumors
metastatic cancer, end-stage renal disease, congestive heart failure, acute liver disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

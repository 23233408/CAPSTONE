* standardising values (Labresults)
  

- How do we standardise time? Given that irregular time-series?
	- Admit time
	- First abnormal recorded lab result


* structure of the pivoted dataset 


- imbalanced dataset advice
	- stratified sampling 
	- SMOTE (Oversampling for imbalanced classification) 

  

- Do we limit our age demographic data? 
	- dropping 0 and 130
	- younger and older patients are more susceptible  

* imputing median age
	* should be based on age removing

* older patients are at risk of commorbidities 



  
  

- Should we identify time of onset?
	- We were thinking of using 

  

- store in a structured form, so can be accessed in a uniform way

  

- Missing HADM_ID 
	- Technique, proportion that you couldn’t find

  

  


T.I.M.E (Temperature, Infection, Mental ability, and End-of-life feeling)

  

- Mental ability and end-of-life feeling are based on observations taken by the clinician.  

- difficult values to monitor
- Are these measurements used to confirm sepsis?

patient
	HADM_ID
		time

Categorical data, no changes (gender)
Sparse time series (one or two changes (age))
Differently sampled time series


Initial time series model
Feed this to another model that is categorical

Run diff. classifiers based on each time series


**Try**
Nearest neighbour interpolation 
	- @ 38:30
		- if you plot this, you'd see square



Standardise time
* either use:
	* Use hours till sepsis onset
	* Time of admission

Standardise the units (ml, mg etc.)



@ 11:44
Random forrest
	- resampling
	- 



Neural network based time series (LSTM)
**Pytorch**
Papers with code




Individual models, one for each time series



Develop on a subset of the data
Till predictions look okay, expand out
Test on 10% sample - for model training time
	- is it worth running on GPU



start with vanilla RNN on LSTM
